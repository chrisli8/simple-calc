When running the SimpleCalc.swift you can do + - * / %. You can do this by typing a number, then a operator on the next line, and then another number on the next line. The console then prints the result

The program also supports counting, average, and factorial. To use these, type a series of numbers followed by "count" or "avg" or "fact". Fact only takes one number.

(e.g.) 10 4 25 17 5 count 
       => 5

       2 4 6 8 10 avg 
       => 6

       2 4 6 8 10 avg 
       => 6
